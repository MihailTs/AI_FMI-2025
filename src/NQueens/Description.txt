The input is a positive integer n (up to 10,000 ±10).
Output -1 when n ∈ {2,3}; otherwise print a one-dimensional
representation of a solution as a permutation where each index
is a column and each value is the row of the queen (0- or 1-based accepted),
e.g. [2, 0, 3, 1].
The output may be a simple list of values rather than strict array notation.

Input
4

Output
[2, 0, 3, 1]
